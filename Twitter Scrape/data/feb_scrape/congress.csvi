In @INCIndia SM team is very weak or some what showing no winning interest. @RahulGandhi @priyankagandhi must take a note of it
"@sujitnair90 @INCIndia Mrs Priyanka Vadra cannot build up Congress party in UP alone,as UP is one of the biggest states with 25 crore population.She should also take support of her brother Varun Gandhi to build &amp;strengthen the party &amp; cadre from gross root level so as to secure respectable no of seats"

"@sujitnair90 @INCIndia Unless and Untill Congress party secure &gt;100 seats on its own , it can never take a lead .hence must concentrate on strengthening its organisation, joining young cadre and increasing its tally.Otherwise the divided opposition parties can never unite and defeat BJP in near future"

"@sujitnair90 @INCIndia All the opposition must realise and remember the fundamental Principle ‚ÄúUnited they gain, Divided they loose‚Äù. Because the BJP succeeded in restricting the main opposition national party to double digit nos &lt;50 and reduced it to the level of a Regional party."
"@SupriyaShrinate @ECISVEEP @RahulGandhi @INCIndia @INCUttarPradesh Why is the congress party not taking up this issue strongly. If election commission is sleeping, why not approach the court."
@INCIndia @RahulGandhi Government did benefit
"@sujitnair90 @INCIndia The Congress-Mamata spat has been pickled ever since Mamata walked out several years back. Their relationship is like ""never judge a book by the cover"" phrase. The inner mistrust is what is killing the opposition to the bigots. The day they introspect, BJP can be thrown out."
@capt_amarinder @INCIndia We Donot think so. You were the puppet of bjp. You have no backbone sir. (kursi ke liye kuch bhi)

Root cause of all hyper activism of @INCIndia leadership under @RahulGandhi against Modi &amp; his Govt is the MOU signed by him on behalf of @INCIndia with #CCP in 2008
